## Modules

The project is organized into several modules:

- **app:** Main Android application module containing UI and presentation logic.
- **data:** Module responsible for data handling, including database operations and data sources.
- **domain:** Module containing business logic and domain entities.
- **shared-ui:** Shared module containing utilities, extensions, and common functionalities.

## Architecture

The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for a clean separation of concerns:

- **Model:** Data and business logic reside in the `domain` and `data` modules.
- **View:** UI components implemented using Jetpack Compose in the `app` module.
- **ViewModel:** Handles UI-related logic and interacts with the domain layer. Implemented in the `app` module.

## Dependencies

- **Hilt:** Dependency injection library for Android.
- **Room:** Persistence library for local database storage.
- **Coroutines:** Kotlin's asynchronous programming library.
- **Navigation Component:** Android Jetpack's navigation library for managing navigation and deep linking.
- **Lifecycle Components:** Set of libraries to build lifecycle-aware components.
- **ViewModel:** Part of Android Architecture Components for managing UI-related data.
- **Materi


al Components:** Library that provides Material Design components.
- **JUnit & Mockito:** Testing libraries for unit testing and mocking dependencies.
